            <h2>What Is Spontaneous Human Combustion?</h2>

            <p>Spontaneous Human Combustion (SHC) refers to the alleged phenomenon of a human body catching fire without any apparent external ignition source. Popular accounts typically describe bodies reduced to ash with only the extremities (feet, hands) surviving, while surrounding furniture and objects remain largely undamaged.</p>

            <p><strong>The verdict:</strong> SHC as a paranormal or medically anomalous phenomenon does not exist. All well-documented cases are explained by the <em>wick effect</em> — a slow, low-temperature combustion process fueled by human body fat and clothing. This is not controversial in forensic science.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Wick Effect: How It Actually Works</h2>

            <p>The wick effect was first experimentally demonstrated by Dr. John de Haan of the California Criminalistics Institute in 1998, and has since been replicated multiple times.</p>

            <h3>Mechanism</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Ignition:</strong> An external ignition source (dropped cigarette, candle, open flame) ignites clothing on the body</li>
                <li><strong>Initial burn:</strong> The clothing burns briefly and begins to heat the skin beneath</li>
                <li><strong>Fat liquefaction:</strong> Body fat melts and seeps into the clothing, which acts as a wick (exactly as in a candle — fat is the fuel, fabric is the wick)</li>
                <li><strong>Sustained combustion:</strong> The fat-soaked clothing sustains a low-temperature flame (~250–300°C) for hours to days</li>
                <li><strong>Selective destruction:</strong> The low temperature is sufficient to consume soft tissue and bone, but insufficient to spread fire to furniture or carpet in most cases — explaining the "undamaged surroundings" characteristic</li>
                <li><strong>Limb survival:</strong> Extremities (hands, feet) often survive because they contain little fat and are positioned away from the wick zone</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Experimental Confirmation</h3>
            <p>De Haan's 1998 experiment with a pig carcass (similar fat distribution to a human body) wrapped in cloth reproduced all the characteristics traditionally attributed to SHC: localized destruction of the body, intact surroundings, and surviving extremities. The experiment required only an external ignition source — no internal spontaneous combustion occurred or was needed.</p>

            <p>The experiment was subsequently demonstrated on the BBC documentary "QED: Body of Fire" (1998), and the wick effect is now accepted in forensic pathology and fire investigation as the explanation for these cases.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Historical Cases Re-examined</h2>

            <h3>Mary Reeser (1951)</h3>
            <p>The most famous American SHC case. Reeser, a 67-year-old woman in St. Petersburg, Florida, was found reduced to ash in her armchair; her left foot survived. The FBI investigated. The forensic conclusion: Reeser had taken sleeping pills and was a smoker. She likely fell asleep while smoking, igniting her nightgown. The wick effect sustained the combustion for hours. The armchair's springs and some floor area were damaged; the rest of the apartment was unaffected because the fire was contained and low-temperature.</p>

            <h3>Michael Faherty (2010)</h3>
            <p>An Irish case often cited as a 21st-century SHC example. Coroner Ciaran McLaughlin made international headlines by recording the cause of death as "spontaneous combustion" — the first Irish coroner to do so. Critically, an open fireplace was adjacent to the body. Multiple forensic fire investigators subsequently argued this was a clear wick effect case with the fireplace as the ignition source. The coroner's ruling reflected uncertainty, not a scientific determination that SHC occurred.</p>

            <h3>Countess Bandi of Casena (1731)</h3>
            <p>One of the earliest documented European cases. The Countess's charred remains were found in her bedroom; the room was largely undamaged. This and similar historical cases predate modern forensic understanding. Given what we now know about the wick effect, these cases fit the standard pattern: elderly, sedentary individuals (often with high body fat percentage), near a heat or ignition source, with no one else present to extinguish the fire quickly.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Risk Factors (All Conventional)</h2>

            <p>Cases attributed to SHC share a consistent set of ordinary risk factors:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smoking</strong> — the most common ignition source; cigarettes can smoulder undetected</li>
                <li><strong>Alcohol intoxication or sedative use</strong> — reduces awareness and ability to respond to pain</li>
                <li><strong>Elderly and/or obese</strong> — higher body fat provides more fuel; reduced mobility</li>
                <li><strong>Living alone</strong> — no one to extinguish early stages of fire</li>
                <li><strong>Sedentary posture</strong> — sitting or lying in one position for extended periods concentrates the wick effect</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity to ignition sources</strong> — fireplaces, candles, heaters, cooking surfaces</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This profile — elderly, sedentary, smoking, alcohol, alone — describes a known high-risk group for fire death generally. SHC cases are not a separate phenomenon but the tail of this existing distribution.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Why the "Spontaneous" Narrative Persists</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visceral imagery:</strong> A body reduced to ash while the chair survives is genuinely counterintuitive and striking</li>
                <li><strong>Absence of obvious ignition source:</strong> When investigators don't immediately find a cigarette stub or candle, "spontaneous" seems like an explanation — it's actually a gap in investigation</li>
                <li><strong>Historical forensic limitations:</strong> Pre-modern investigators lacked the tools or framework to understand low-temperature sustained combustion</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural reinforcement:</strong> Dickens used SHC in "Bleak House" (1853); popular fiction has sustained the idea for 170+ years</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Is Any Aspect Genuinely Unexplained?</h2>

            <p>The honest answer is <strong>no</strong>. The wick effect explains all documented physical characteristics. The occasional uncertainty in specific cases reflects gaps in investigation (missing the ignition source) rather than evidence of an anomalous process.</p>

            <p>There is no verified case where: (a) an external ignition source is definitively excluded, (b) the physical evidence is inconsistent with the wick effect, and (c) the case has been subjected to rigorous modern forensic analysis. Cases that seem mysterious on first read consistently dissolve under scrutiny.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Spontaneous Human Combustion is the lowest-priority phenomenon in this series because it is the most thoroughly resolved. The wick effect is experimentally demonstrated, consistently explains documented cases, and is accepted in forensic science. No additional research into "SHC as a phenomenon" is warranted.</p>

            <p>The genuine takeaway is a public safety message: elderly individuals who smoke, drink, or use sedatives, living alone, face a real risk of slow fire death that is preventable. This is a known fire safety problem with known interventions (smoking cessation, supervised living situations, smoke detectors) — not a paranormal mystery.</p>

            <p><em>Priority Score: 1.0/10 — Solved. Not a scientific mystery. The appropriate response is fire prevention education, not further investigation.</em></p>
