            <h2>The Signal</h2>
            
            <p>On <strong>August 15, 1977, at 22:16 EDT</strong>, Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope detected a <strong>72-second narrowband radio signal</strong> at 1420 MHz (the hydrogen line) from the direction of constellation Sagittarius. The signal was so unusual that astronomer <strong>Jerry Ehman</strong> circled the printout data and wrote "<strong>Wow!</strong>" in the margin the next morning—giving the phenomenon its enduring name.</p>

            <h3>Key Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> At least 72 seconds (full window of Big Ear's observation)</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 1420.4556 MHz (±0.005 MHz) — near the hydrogen line (1420.406 MHz)</li>
                <li><strong>Intensity:</strong> 30 times stronger than background noise</li>
                <li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> Less than 10 kHz (extremely narrow)</li>
                <li><strong>Polarization:</strong> Unknown (Big Ear could not measure polarization)</li>
                <li><strong>Direction:</strong> Right ascension 19h25m31s ± 10s, declination −26°57′ ± 20′ (J2000)</li>
                <li><strong>Rise and fall:</strong> Matched expected pattern for celestial source (gradually intensified, peaked, then faded)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why It Stood Out</h3>
            <p>The Wow! Signal exhibited several characteristics that made it remarkable:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Narrowband transmission:</strong> Natural cosmic radio sources are typically broadband; extremely narrow signals suggest technological origin</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrogen line frequency:</strong> 1420 MHz is considered a "universal" frequency for interstellar communication—it's the transition frequency of neutral hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe</li>
                <li><strong>Intensity profile:</strong> The signal's rise and fall precisely matched what would be expected from a distant point source being tracked by Big Ear's beam pattern</li>
                <li><strong>Non-terrestrial origin:</strong> The frequency was (at the time) protected by international agreement from terrestrial transmission</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>The Evidence</h2>
            
            <blockquote>
                <strong>Primary Documentation:</strong><br>
                The only evidence is the original IBM 1130 computer printout showing six alphanumeric characters ("6EQUJ5") representing the signal intensity over six 10-second intervals. Jerry Ehman's handwritten "Wow!" remains the most famous marginal note in SETI history.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Data Encoding</h3>
            <p>Big Ear used an alphanumeric system to represent signal intensity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1-9:</strong> Intensity levels 1-9 sigma above background</li>
                <li><strong>A-Z:</strong> Intensity levels 10-35 sigma above background</li>
                <li><strong>Blank space:</strong> No significant signal</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The sequence "6EQUJ5" translates to intensity levels: 6, 14, 26, 30, 19, 5 sigma above background. The "U" (30 sigma) represents the peak—an extraordinarily strong signal.</p>

            <h3>Observation Constraints</h3>
            <p>Big Ear's design imposed several limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single feed horn:</strong> Only one of two feed horns detected the signal; the second (3 minutes behind in the sky) saw nothing</li>
                <li><strong>72-second window:</strong> Big Ear's beam width gave a 72-second observation window per source</li>
                <li><strong>No recording:</strong> Data was printed in real-time; the original signal was not recorded</li>
                <li><strong>No polarization data:</strong> Unable to determine if signal was circularly or linearly polarized</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Follow-Up Searches</h2>
            
            <p>Despite numerous attempts, the Wow! Signal has <strong>never been detected again</strong>:</p>

            <h3>Historical Search Efforts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1987-1989:</strong> Robert Gray conducted META (Megachannel ExtraTerrestrial Assay) searches—no detection</li>
                <li><strong>1995-1996:</strong> Gray used Harvard-Smithsonian's 84-foot antenna for 50+ hours—no detection</li>
                <li><strong>1999:</strong> Gray & Simon Ellingsen used University of Tasmania's 26-meter dish—no detection</li>
                <li><strong>2012:</strong> Arecibo Observatory targeted the region—no detection</li>
                <li><strong>2016:</strong> Breakthrough Listen observed the region for 40 hours—no detection</li>
                <li><strong>2020:</strong> Multiple independent radio telescope arrays monitored the area—no detection</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why No Repeat?</h3>
            <p>Several hypotheses explain the non-repeatability:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Transient transmission:</strong> If artificial, it may have been a brief, non-repeating signal</li>
                <li><strong>Highly directional beam:</strong> A focused transmission might have swept past Earth once and never returned</li>
                <li><strong>Earth-based interference:</strong> Despite safeguards, could have been terrestrial (though this seems unlikely given the characteristics)</li>
                <li><strong>Natural transient:</strong> An unknown astrophysical phenomenon that occurred once</li>
                <li><strong>Orbital dynamics:</strong> If from an exoplanet, orbital motion might mean decades between alignments</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Proposed Explanations</h2>

            <h3>1. Extraterrestrial Intelligence (Original Hypothesis)</h3>
            <p><strong>For:</strong> Narrow bandwidth, hydrogen line frequency, intensity profile, celestial origin<br>
            <strong>Against:</strong> Never repeated, only one feed horn detected it, protected frequency (unlikely ET would know international agreements)</p>

            <h3>2. Comet Hydrogen Cloud (2017 Theory)</h3>
            <p>Astronomer Antonio Paris proposed that hydrogen clouds surrounding comets 266P/Christensen and P/2008 Y2 (Gibbs) could emit naturally at 1420 MHz.</p>
            <p><strong>For:</strong> Comets were in the vicinity in 1977, natural hydrogen emission<br>
            <strong>Against:</strong> Subsequent observations of these comets showed no such emissions; bandwidth too narrow for natural process</p>

            <h3>3. Interstellar Scintillation</h3>
            <p>Passing through turbulent interstellar medium could have temporarily focused a weak broadband source into a narrowband spike.</p>
            <p><strong>For:</strong> Explains one-time occurrence<br>
            <strong>Against:</strong> Would require extraordinary coincidence of alignment</p>

            <h3>4. Terrestrial Interference Reflection</h3>
            <p>Earthly transmission reflected off space debris or atmospheric layer.</p>
            <p><strong>For:</strong> Explains non-repeatability<br>
            <strong>Against:</strong> Frequency was protected; signal intensity profile matched celestial source, not reflection</p>

            <h3>5. Unknown Natural Astrophysical Phenomenon</h3>
            <p>A previously unknown transient cosmic radio event.</p>
            <p><strong>For:</strong> Many transient phenomena (FRBs, magnetar flares) were unknown in 1977<br>
            <strong>Against:</strong> Extremely narrow bandwidth inconsistent with known natural sources</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Modern Context & Fast Radio Bursts</h2>
            
            <p>The discovery of <strong>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)</strong> in 2007—brief, intense radio pulses from distant galaxies—provides new context for the Wow! Signal. While FRBs are now known to be natural (likely magnetar flares), they demonstrate that transient, non-repeating radio phenomena do occur.</p>

            <h3>Similarities to FRBs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Brief duration</li>
                <li>High intensity</li>
                <li>Non-repeating (in many cases)</li>
                <li>Extragalactic origin</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differences from FRBs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bandwidth:</strong> FRBs are broadband; Wow! Signal was extremely narrowband</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> FRBs last milliseconds; Wow! Signal lasted at least 72 seconds</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> FRBs occur across wide frequency range; Wow! Signal was precisely at hydrogen line</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Wow! Signal's characteristics remain <strong>inconsistent with all known natural radio sources</strong>, making it a genuine anomaly even in light of modern discoveries.</p>

            <h2>Scientific Impact</h2>
            
            <h3>Influence on SETI</h3>
            <p>The Wow! Signal fundamentally shaped modern SETI protocols:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verification requirements:</strong> Legitimate candidate signals must be detected by multiple telescopes and confirmed over time</li>
                <li><strong>Automated follow-up:</strong> Modern SETI uses rapid autonomous reobservation systems</li>
                <li><strong>Data recording:</strong> All observations are now recorded digitally for post-detection analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-beam receivers:</strong> Current telescopes use arrays that observe multiple sky positions simultaneously</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Reproducibility is essential:</strong> Single observations, no matter how compelling, cannot be considered definitive</li>
                <li><strong>Instrumental limitations matter:</strong> Big Ear's single-feed design prevented immediate verification</li>
                <li><strong>Archival importance:</strong> The printout's survival allows ongoing analysis with modern techniques</li>
                <li><strong>Patience required:</strong> If a genuine extraterrestrial signal, Earth might not be the intended recipient—it could be decades or centuries before repetition</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Current Status & Future Prospects</h2>
            
            <h3>Ongoing Monitoring</h3>
            <p>The Wow! Signal region continues to be monitored sporadically:</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>

            <h3>Unanswered Questions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>What generated the signal?</strong> Natural or artificial origin remains unknown</li>
                <li><strong>Why hasn't it repeated?</strong> Was it truly one-time, or have we missed recurrences?</li>
                <li><strong>Could it return?</strong> If from an exoplanet civilization, orbital dynamics might cause periodic alignment</li>
                <li><strong>What was the source's distance?</strong> Local (exoplanet) vs. distant (intergalactic) unknown</li>
                <li><strong>Did the other feed horn actually see nothing?</strong> Some debate exists about whether that data was properly examined</li>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            
            <p>The Wow! Signal remains significant for several reasons:</p>

            <h3>1. Exemplar of Scientific Uncertainty</h3>
            <p>It demonstrates that even well-documented observations can resist explanation, highlighting the limits of single-point data and the importance of reproducibility in science.</p>

            <h3>2. SETI Methodology Cornerstone</h3>
            <p>Every modern SETI protocol references the Wow! Signal as the cautionary tale and aspirational goal—what to look for and how to verify it.</p>

            <h3>3. Public Engagement</h3>
            <p>Few scientific observations capture public imagination like the Wow! Signal. It represents humanity's hope and uncertainty about our place in the cosmos.</p>

            <h3>4. Philosophical Implications</h3>
            <p>If artificial, it raises profound questions: Was it intended for detection? Are we peripheral to a larger cosmic conversation? If natural, what unknown physics might it reveal?</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p>The Wow! Signal remains <strong>the most compelling unexplained radio signal in SETI history</strong>. Nearly five decades after detection, it defies categorization: too unusual to dismiss, too unreproducible to confirm, and inconsistent with all known natural phenomena.</p>

            <p>Whether evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, an unknown astrophysical process, or an extraordinarily unlikely instrumental artifact, the Wow! Signal stands as a reminder that the universe still holds mysteries that resist our best efforts at explanation. It shaped modern SETI, demonstrated the critical importance of reproducibility in science, and continues to inspire both scientific inquiry and public fascination.</p>

            <p>The truth may only emerge through patience, improved technology, and—perhaps—the signal's eventual return.</p>
