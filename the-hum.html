            <h2>Phenomenon Description</h2>

            <p>The Hum is a persistent, low-frequency noise (typically 30–80 Hz) reported by approximately 2–4% of the population in affected areas. It is characterized by its <strong>selective audibility</strong> — only a minority of people in any location can hear it — and is often described as resembling a diesel engine idling in the distance. It tends to be <strong>louder indoors than outdoors</strong> and <strong>worse at night</strong>, which distinguishes it from most conventional industrial noise.</p>

            <h3>Consistent Characteristics Across Reports</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> 30–80 Hz (infrasound to low audible range)</li>
                <li><strong>Character:</strong> Throbbing or pulsing, diesel-like, continuous with slight variations</li>
                <li><strong>Directionality:</strong> Reporters often struggle to identify a direction; seems omnipresent</li>
                <li><strong>Indoor amplification:</strong> Louder inside buildings than outside — consistent with structural resonance</li>
                <li><strong>Night prevalence:</strong> More noticeable at night when ambient noise masks it less</li>
                <li><strong>Effects:</strong> Sleep disruption, headaches, anxiety, nausea in severe cases</li>
                <li><strong>Selective perception:</strong> Only ~2–4% of people in any location report hearing it</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Notable Cases</h2>

            <h3>The Bristol Hum (UK, 1970s–present)</h3>
            <p>One of the earliest documented large-scale reports. Thousands of residents in Bristol, England reported a persistent low-frequency noise from the late 1970s onward. A 1980 UK government investigation identified industrial and pipeline-related infrasound as partial sources but could not fully explain the phenomenon.</p>

            <h3>The Taos Hum (New Mexico, USA, 1991–present)</h3>
            <p>Residents of Taos, New Mexico began reporting a persistent low-frequency hum in the early 1990s. A 1997 congressional investigation by researchers from multiple universities (including Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos) found that approximately 2% of the population could hear it, but failed to identify a single source. A natural-gas pipeline, geomagnetic micro-pulsations, and very-low-frequency (VLF) military communications were all investigated. The Taos Hum remains the most scientifically studied instance.</p>

            <h3>Windsor Hum (Ontario/Michigan, 2011–2020)</h3>
            <p>Residents on both sides of the US-Canada border near Windsor, Ontario reported a persistent hum beginning around 2011. A 2014 Canadian government investigation identified blast furnace operations at a Zug Island steel plant in Michigan as the likely source. This is one of the few cases where a specific industrial source was confidently identified.</p>

            <h3>Global Distribution</h3>
            <p>Reports come from New Zealand, Scotland, Norway, Australia, and throughout North America. The consistency of description across cultures and geographies suggests a real acoustic phenomenon rather than mass psychogenic illness — though the explanation likely differs by location.</p>

            <h2>Scientific Analysis of Competing Explanations</h2>

            <h3>Explanation 1: Industrial Infrasound (Confirmed for some cases)</h3>
            <p>Compressor stations, pipelines, wind turbines, and industrial facilities generate infrasound in the 1–100 Hz range. Infrasound travels enormous distances with minimal attenuation and can induce structural resonance in buildings (explaining the indoor amplification). The Windsor case is the clearest example of industrial attribution.</p>
            <p><strong>Evidence quality: HIGH for specific cases.</strong> Cannot explain all global reports, particularly in remote areas.</p>

            <h3>Explanation 2: SOFAR Channel / Ocean Microseisms</h3>
            <p>The ocean generates persistent low-frequency acoustic energy from wave-wave interactions (the "microseismic peak" at ~0.2 Hz and harmonics). The SOFAR (Sound Fixing and Ranging) channel can propagate low-frequency sound globally with minimal loss. Some researchers propose that continental areas may be exposed to distant ocean infrasound sources.</p>
            <p><strong>Evidence quality: MEDIUM.</strong> Established physics; unclear whether it explains onshore reports at audible frequencies.</p>

            <h3>Explanation 3: VLF Military Communications</h3>
            <p>Very Low Frequency (3–30 kHz) military submarine communications (like the US Navy's ELF/VLF transmitters) create electromagnetic fields that could potentially induce auditory perception in some individuals via bone conduction or otoacoustic mechanisms. The selective hearing of only a minority of people could be explained by individual variation in susceptibility.</p>
            <p><strong>Evidence quality: LOW.</strong> Mechanism is speculative; frequencies don't fully align; no controlled evidence.</p>

            <h3>Explanation 4: Otoacoustic Emissions / Tinnitus Variant</h3>
            <p>The inner ear can generate sounds (otoacoustic emissions). Some neurologists propose that certain individuals experience a variant of low-frequency tinnitus that resembles an external sound. The selective hearing, difficulty localizing the source, and lack of consistent instrumentation findings support a partial neurological component.</p>
            <p><strong>Evidence quality: MEDIUM.</strong> Likely contributes to a subset of reports; doesn't explain cases where multiple independent observers simultaneously report the same phenomenon.</p>

            <h3>Explanation 5: Seismic Microactivity</h3>
            <p>Low-level continuous seismic activity ("seismic noise") at certain frequencies could be transmitted through bedrock and perceived by people as a hum. Some affected areas show elevated seismic background activity.</p>
            <p><strong>Evidence quality: LOW.</strong> Not well-correlated with actual seismic data in most cases.</p>

            <h2>What Makes This Hard to Study</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infrasound measurement is technically demanding</strong> — requires specialized microphones, careful isolation from wind noise, and long averaging times</li>
                <li><strong>The selective perception effect</strong> — if only 2% of people hear it, controlled experiments require large sample sizes</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental noise floor</strong> — industrial civilization generates a dense low-frequency acoustic environment; separating "the Hum" from ambient noise requires careful methodology</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-source reality</strong> — different instances of "the Hum" may have different causes, making a single unified explanation elusive</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Research Recommendations</h2>

            <h3>Priority 1: Systematic Infrasound Survey</h3>
            <p>Deploy calibrated infrasound sensor arrays in a high-density grid across an active Hum-reporting area. Cross-correlate sensor data to identify source direction and distance. This is technically feasible and would definitively characterize the acoustic environment. Cost: $500K–$2 million.</p>

            <h3>Priority 2: Comparative Audiology Study</h3>
            <p>Recruit matched cohorts of Hum hearers and non-hearers from the same location. Test sensitivity to low-frequency tones and infrasound under controlled conditions. Measure otoacoustic emissions. Would establish the neurological component's contribution. Cost: $200–500K.</p>

            <h3>Priority 3: Source Correlation</h3>
            <p>For cases in industrialized areas, correlate Hum intensity reports with operational schedules of nearby industrial facilities, pipeline pressure variations, and wind turbine operation. The Windsor precedent shows this can identify sources definitively.</p>

            <h3>What Would Resolve This</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Simultaneous acoustic measurement and subject perception study in an active Hum location</li>
                <li>Identification of the source via directional infrasound array</li>
                <li>Or: controlled audiology demonstrating a purely perceptual mechanism</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>The Hum is real: people are genuinely experiencing something, and in at least one case (Windsor) the source was identified as an industrial facility. The full explanation is almost certainly <strong>multi-causal</strong>: industrial infrasound for some cases, individual auditory sensitivity variation for others, and possibly novel acoustic propagation mechanisms for the remainder.</p>

            <p>This is a tractable problem. A well-designed infrasound survey combined with comparative audiology would likely close 80% of the mystery within 3–5 years.</p>

            <p><em>Priority Score: 5.0/10 — Real phenomenon, real sufferers, tractable with targeted investment. Not mysterious enough to be exciting but worth resolving for the people affected.</em></p>
