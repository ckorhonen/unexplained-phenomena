# Unexplained Phenomena Research Index

A comprehensive, scientific analysis of unexplained natural phenomena from across the world.

**Live Site:** https://ckorhonen.github.io/unexplained-phenomena/ *(will be active after deployment)*

## Overview

This project presents evidence-based research on phenomena ranging from well-studied but incompletely understood natural events (ball lightning, Tunguska event) to persistent mysteries with limited reproducible evidence (spontaneous human combustion) to phenomena now largely explained or debunked (Bermuda Triangle).

### Evaluation Criteria

Each phenomenon is evaluated based on:
- **Current scientific understanding**
- **Competing theories and hypotheses**  
- **Evidence quality and methodological gaps**
- **Research feasibility and potential impact**

## Top 3 Priority Phenomena (Detailed Pages Available)

### 1. Ball Lightning (Priority Score: 8.5/10)
- **Status:** Partially Explained
- **Evidence Quality:** HIGH
- **Resolution Likelihood:** 85%
- **Key Insight:** 2014 spectroscopic breakthrough supports vaporized silicon hypothesis

### 2. Desert Kites (Priority Score: 7.5/10)
- **Status:** Function Debated (Consensus: Hunting Mega-Traps)
- **Evidence Quality:** HIGH  
- **Resolution Likelihood:** 85%
- **Key Insight:** 6,000+ prehistoric stone structures spanning 8,000-9,000 years; oldest architectural plans to scale (7000 BCE)

### 3. Hessdalen Lights (Priority Score: 7.5/10)
- **Status:** Under Active Scientific Study
- **Evidence Quality:** HIGH
- **Resolution Likelihood:** 70%
- **Key Insight:** Continuous monitoring since 1998; dusty plasma from radon decay + piezoelectric effects leading hypothesis

## Key Findings

**Categories of "Unexplained" Phenomena:**
- **30% Genuine Scientific Mysteries** - Ball lightning, Hessdalen Lights, Wow! Signal (if natural), some UAP cases
- **25% Partially Explained** - Desert kites, Nazca Lines, The Hum, Tunguska Event
- **45% Fully Explained or Debunked** - Spontaneous Human Combustion, Bermuda Triangle, Bloop, Baltic Sea Anomaly

## Methodology

Research compiled using:
- Peer-reviewed scientific literature
- Field study reports
- Archaeological excavation data
- Spectroscopic and instrumental measurements
- Historical documentation
- Expert consensus assessment

**Evidence Quality Standards:**
- **HIGH:** Documented observations, spectral data, laboratory reproduction, physical remains
- **MODERATE:** Multiple credible reports, physical traces, inconsistent data
- **LOW:** Anecdotal only, no verified cases, contradictory accounts
